</h4>
<br/>
<p>
In a longitudinal study we have fitted two marginal models for continuous data.
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>Model I: has errors with constant variance over time, and an AR-1 correlation 
structure.</li>
<li>Model II: allows the variance of the error terms to change over time, and has a Gaussian
correlation structure.</li>
</ul>
Both models have the same mean specification (i.e., regression coefficients), and have 
been fitted using restricted maximum likelihood (REML). We want to decide which model 
fits the data better.
